# SearchTool
Allows recursive searching through a directory or a specific file for a keyword and write an output file if content is found


Features:
  1) Executes from Terminal
  2) Terminal will ask for a file to search specifically (name of the file) so you can find where the file is located
  3) Or a directory search which takes in a keyword and looks for what files have that keyword
  4) Both output their findings into a file
  
  
   ** must use concurrency by implementing multiple threads for fast results
